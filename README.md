I am an open minded individual with the ability to think on my feet. I work very well in a team environment, and I get along with others easily. I am an analytical person and I enjoy problem solving. I am studying Software Engineering with Code Space because it is a path suited for me. I am willing to learn new things and that will improve my skills. I am looking forward to become a Junior Software Developer.
